  - Testimonial model
  - Blog model
  - Contact model
- ❌ Implement model validation for all models
- ❌ Add indexes to frequently queried fields
- ❌ Consider moving to PostgreSQL for production

#### Testing

- ❌ Create integration tests for form submissions
- ❌ Set up end-to-end testing
- ❌ Implement test coverage reporting
- ❌ Add continuous integration pipeline

#### Frontend Improvements
- ❌ All frontend improvements listed in tasks.md

#### DevOps and Deployment
- ❌ Set up separate settings for different environments
- ❌ Configure static file serving in production
- ❌ Set up media file handling
- ❌ Implement proper deployment strategy

#### Documentation
- ❌ Create comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- ❌ Document API endpoints
- ❌ Add inline code documentation

## Recommendations for Next Steps

Based on the current state of the project, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Complete Security Improvements**
   - Move SECRET_KEY to environment variables
   - Configure DEBUG setting to be environment-dependent
   - Set up proper ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration

2. **Enhance Database Models**
   - Implement the remaining models (Service, Testimonial, Blog, Contact)
   - Add proper validation to all models
   - Add indexes to frequently queried fields

3. **Expand Testing Coverage**
   - Implement view tests
   - Create integration tests for form submissions
   - Set up test coverage reporting

4. **Improve Backend Functionality**
   - Complete view logic implementation
   - Create API endpoints for dynamic content
   - Implement server-side form validation
   - Set up email functionality for contact form submissions

5. **Set Up Development and Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Configure separate settings for development, testing, and production
   - Set up proper static and media file handling
   - Implement a deployment strategy

## How to Run Tests

To run the model tests that have been created:

```bash
python manage.py test music_beta.tests.test_models
```

## How to Seed the Database

To seed the database with fake data:

```bash
# Basic usage with default values
python manage.py generate_fake_data

# Custom usage with specific counts
python manage.py generate_fake_data --genres 5 --artists 10 --albums 15 --tracks 50 --users 8 --ad_campaigns 12 --service_requests 20
```

## Conclusion

The TFN Media project has made good progress in setting up the basic data models and development tools. However, there are still many tasks that need to be completed before the project can be considered production-ready. By following the recommended next steps, the project can continue to move forward in a structured and efficient manner.
