- there should be more a sort of "trending now"

- there should be modals for when things happen (ie: try to play a song without being registered or logged in)
- video upload size limit (to help us save space, please consider pasting in a video url like from youtube or something. We're a start up and server storage space is expensive :D

- for uploading songs, it integrates with id3 package so we can collect the audio metadata on the backend
